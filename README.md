**Task 4 : ATM Interface**

This is an ATM simulation with fundamental functionalities like checking account balance, withdrawing funds, and depositing money. 
The program uses a HashMap to store user accounts, where the PIN serves as the key, allowing users to access their accounts securely.

**Key Features**
User account creation and management using PIN as a unique identifier.
Account balance checking to keep track of available funds. 
Safe withdrawal process, ensuring sufficient balance before allowing withdrawals.
Convenient deposit option to add money to the account.

**How to Use**
To run the ATM Machine program, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine. 
Compile the Java files using **'javac ATM.java'**.
Run the program.

**Usage **
Upon starting the program, enter your PIN to access your account. 
If you don't have an account, you'll be prompted to create one.
Once logged in, you can select from various options available in the main menu, such as checking account balance, withdrawing money, depositing funds, and more.

**Disclaimer**
This project is intended for educational purposes and serves as a basic demonstration of Java programming concepts.

I hope you find this ATM Machine implementation in Java useful and a great way to learn the basics of Java programming and HashMaps.
**Happy coding!** ðŸš€ðŸ’»
